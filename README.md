# My-Projects #
## Cellular Automaton Model of the Heart ##

This documents the progress with my dissertation project. I named it badly and don't know how to change the name so I'm stuck with the name "My-Projects" for now. 

## Currently working on: ##
- Conway's Game of Life
- 2D simulation of a heart valve


## Future plans: ##
- Experimenting with a 3D modelling library
- More accurate heart modelling stuff
