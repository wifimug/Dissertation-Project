# Notes on determining model size #

## The human heart ##
The average heart contains an estimated 2-3 billion 
cardiac muscle cells - making up for 1/3 of all cells in the heart.
Average size is 12cm long and 8-9cm wide and 2.5cm deep.


## Modelling the left atria ##
From the paper "Mechanisms of stochastic onset and termination of atrial 
fibrillation studied with a cellular automaton model", the left atria is 
40ml, which has a radius of 21.1mm.

Translated to a square, with area 1385.4mm, which has sides the length of 37.2mm.
The mitral valve at the bottom have the circumference of 85mm, radius of 13.5mm.

The 4 ventricles have a base radius of 5mm.
