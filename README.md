## Cellular Automaton Model of the Heart ‚ù§Ô∏è ##

This documents the progress with my dissertation project. I named it badly and don't know how to change the name so I'm stuck with the name "My-Projects" for now. 

## Currently working on: üí≠ ##
- 2D simulation of a heart valve
- Working faster decay model with restitution


## Completed: ‚úÖ ##
- Basic Conway's Game of Life
- Real time model of heart with refractory period and thresholds
- Ticking decay model with refractory period and thresholds
- Draws a graph of active cells to visualize heart rhythm

## Future plans: üìö ##
- Faster ticking decay model, including restitution
- Experimenting with a 3D modelling library
- More accurate heart modelling stuff
