# My-Projects #
## Cellular Automaton Model of the Heart ❤️ ##

This documents the progress with my dissertation project. I named it badly and don't know how to change the name so I'm stuck with the name "My-Projects" for now. 

## Currently working on: 💭 ##
- 2D simulation of a heart valve
- Adding refractory period and action potential parameters
- Adding an interface to easily alter parameters


## Completed: ✅ ##
- Basic Conway's Game of Life

## Future plans: 📚 ##
- Experimenting with a 3D modelling library
- More accurate heart modelling stuff
