# Making a Faster Cellular Automaton #

## Aim to precompute as much as possible before running the recursive updates ## 
Find the coordinates of the neighbours of each cell and store as a lookup table.
Faster than computing the neighbouring cells each iteration.

## Comparison ##

Faster model takes around 1 minute to finish, using the same settings.
Previous model takes around 3 minutes to finish.
